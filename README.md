# BioMicroCenter-PPR_Program Version5
Guaranteeing high quality next-generation sequencing (NGS) data in a rapidly changing environment is an ongoing challenge. The depreciation of specific metrics from Illumina's Sequencing Analysis Viewer (SAV) have made it more difficult to directly determine the baseline error rate of sequencing runs. We have created an open-source tool to construct the Percent Perfect Reads (PPR) plot previously provided by the Illumina sequencers. The PPR program is compatible with HiSeq2000/2500, MiSeq, and NextSeq500 instruments, and provides an alternative to Illumina's Q scores for determining run quality.

In version5, we upgraded dependencies to newer versions including:
bwa/0.7.16a
samtools/1.5
r/3.4.0
fastxtoolkit/0.0.13
bowtie2/2.3.2
bedtools/2.26.0
GNU Parallel
